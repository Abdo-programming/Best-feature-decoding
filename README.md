# Best-feature-decoding
I worked with @mabdelhack to try and classify images seen by participants from their fMRI scans. We did this by correlating the top 1000 relevant features per layer (in Alex-net) to the features produced by preferred images.

# Data used
We used the data featured in https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15037.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1wVvviuO3cQFhTeF-152W2_itsGyqhVgTAT3POGOQa8G6JRvcJ5ugqJT4, produced by the Kamitani lab
